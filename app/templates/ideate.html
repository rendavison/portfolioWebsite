      <b>The IDeATe Modular Classroom</b>
      <p />
      As a final project for my environmental design studio, I was tasked with redesigning an aspect of CMU's <a href="http://ideate.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">IDeATe program.</a>  The program is intended to be an interdisciplinary setting where students in both artistic and STEM fields can collaborate using a variety of methods and materials.  However, due to the new nature of the program, the IDeATe environment is less than ideal, especially in terms of the studio space they currently have.
      <p />
      IDeATe studio spaces are transient, with the potential for a multitude of classes or students needing to utilize the space at the same time.  This leads to an imperfect space with each group only getting some of the advantages and resources they need.  To address this problem, I pitched the idea of a modular furniture system, allowing for further customization of the space to fit specific, yet temporary needs.  The system would consist of cubes that fit together (similar to Legos), in order to create additional working and digital surfaces.  For my presentation, I prepared slides and a concept video.
      <p />
      To arrive at this idea, I did some research, interviewing current IDeATe students and visiting the IDeATe studio space several times, documenting what I saw with both a camera and written descriptions.  Some of my process work is shown to the left.
