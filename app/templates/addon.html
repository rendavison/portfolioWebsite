      <b>"Cherry Blossoms" Tumblr Theme</b>
      <p />
      Most of my open source work, at this point, as been using Tumblr as a platform.  I have released eleven Tumblr themes at this point, this one being the most recent.  With each theme, I try to explore different features, in order to push myself in a design sense, and also pick up more skills and concepts that I can apply in future projects.  All of my themes are completely free to use with attribution, and hundreds of users have used or saved my themes.  My work has also been featured multiple times on the site's leading source for open source themes and pages, <a href="http://theme-hunter.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Theme Hunter.</a>
      <p />
      This theme features a mosaic "grid" format, infinite scroll, option for two or three columns of posts, and easily customizable additional features and colors through the use of Tumblr's meta tag system.  All scripts used that are not mine are properly attributed via inline comments and used with permission.
