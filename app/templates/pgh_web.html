      <b>Made in PGH: Website Component</b>
      <p />
      Made in PGH was a campagin to get college students to explore the city of Pittsburgh. It was a multi-component project, each component targeting a different kind of motivator. The website component targeted the appeals of social media and competition. The website posed a series of challenges, such as "visit every neighborhood and take a photo of your favorite thing that you saw." Participants would then upload their photo to the appropriate challenge gallery, and other people could collaborate on the galleries, comment on them, and share them.
